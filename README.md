**Starcatcher** improves on vanilla's fishing by adding lots of new fishes to be caught through a new mini-game, using your **Starcatcher's Fishing Rod**! 🎣

![Minigame](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1878f20-655c-40cd-9f50-ea18107ee24b)

Fishes are now restricted by a number of conditions, such as Dimension, Biome, Elevation, Daytime, Weather, and more! 🐟 🐠

Starcatcher features a fully in-game guide which will show you where you can catch each fish, alongside it's rarity and more.

Will you fill out your collection? 🔎 Some of these catches are harder than they appear!

### For devs

Each fish is highly costumizable through data-packs, perfect for modpacks and mods looking to add compatibility with their own fishes!

Check the wiki page on how to add your custom fish json with your restrictions, starcatcher will handle everything else.

**Starcatcher has built-in support for mods!** If you're a developer or would like to request out-of-the-box compatibility reach out to me on discord! 

### Currently supported mods:
**Tide** 🌊 - All tide fishes are catchable though Starcatcher, loosely following tide's fish restrictions

**Aquaculture 2** 🐟 - All Aquaculture's fishes are catchable though Starcatcher, loosely following Aquaculture's fish restrictions

**Fish of Thieves** 🦜 - The base versions of Fish of Thieves' fishes are catchable as items though Starcatcher. Better compatibility coming in the future. Probably.
