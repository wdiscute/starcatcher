**Starcatcher** improves on vanilla's fishing by adding lots of new fishes to be caught through a new mini-game, using your **Starcatcher's Fishing Rod**! 🎣

The 90+ new fishes added are restricted by a number of conditions, such as Dimension, Biome, Elevation, Daytime, Weather, Fluid, and more! 🐟 🐠

Starcatcher features a fully in-game guide which will serve as a handy companion throughout your fish catching journey! It will guide you through hooks, bobbers, baits, treasures, trophies and many secrets!

There are several hooks and bobbers made to modify the way you fish, either by aiding the difficulty, or providing an extra challenge for better loot!

Starcatcher also features plenty of secret messages and bits of story to be fished out of the sea 🌊 Will you follow behind Arnwulf the Skeptic's steps?

### For devs

Each fish is highly costumizable through data-packs, perfect for modpacks and mods looking to add compatibility with their own fishes, or gating progression or items behind a specific fishing achievement!

Check the wiki page on how to add your custom fish json with your restrictions, starcatcher will handle everything else.

**Starcatcher has built-in support for mods!** If you're a developer or would like to request out-of-the-box compatibility reach out to me on discord! 

### Currently supported mods:
**Tide** 🌊 - All tide fishes are catchable though Starcatcher, loosely following tide's fish restrictions

**Aquaculture 2** 🐟 - All Aquaculture's fishes are catchable though Starcatcher, loosely following Aquaculture's fish restrictions

**Fish of Thieves** 🦜 - The base versions of Fish of Thieves' fishes are catchable as items though Starcatcher. Better compatibility coming in the future. Probably.
