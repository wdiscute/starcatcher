**Starcatcher** improves on vanilla's fishing by adding lots of new fishes to be caught through a new mini-game, using your **Starcatcher's Fishing Rod**! 🎣

The 90+ new fishes added are restricted by a number of conditions, such as Dimension, Biome, Elevation, Daytime, Weather, Fluid, and more! 🐟 🐠

Starcatcher features a fully in-game guide which will serve as a handy companion throughout your fish catching journey! It will guide you through hooks, bobbers, baits, treasures, trophies and many secrets!
