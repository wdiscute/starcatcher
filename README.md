**Starcatcher** improves on vanilla's fishing by adding lots of new fishes to be caught through a new mini-game, using your **Starcatcher's Fishing Rod**! üé£

Fishes are now restricted by a number of conditions, such as Dimension, Biome, Elevation, Daytime, Weather, and more! üêü üê†

Starcatcher features a fully in-game guide which will show you where you can catch each fish, alongside it's difficulty and extra information.

Will you fill out your collection? Some of these catches are harder than they appear!

Each fish is highly costumizable through data-packs, perfect for modpacks and mods looking to add compatibility with their own fishes!

For modpack and mod developers, check the wiki page on how to add your custom fish with your restrictions to the mod! Starcatcher will handle everything else.
